<!-- 
Include a minimum of 5 survey questions.

Offer a minimum of 3 different language suggestions.

One branch should return one result. It shouldn't be possible to be suggested two languages at once.

Make sure that when the user submits the survey again (for a second or third time), that previous answers are hidden, cleared, or replaced prior to showing the new result.

Don't forget regular Git commits and a detailed README. Commit messages should always be on-topic and professional in tone.
